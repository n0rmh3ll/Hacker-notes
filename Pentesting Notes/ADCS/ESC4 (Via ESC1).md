ESC4 is when there are weak access controls on a certificate template. The output above shows that the Certificate Publishers group has full control over the Dunder Mifflin Authentication template. [This post from Red&Blue Team Security](https://www.rbtsec.com/blog/active-directory-certificate-services-adcs-esc4/) goes into nice detail on how to exploit this.

I’m going to use my control over the template to make it vulnerable to ESC1, and then exploit that.
