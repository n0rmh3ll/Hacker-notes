### While using john with RC4 ( TGT ) hash

```
$krb5tgs$23$*svc_sql$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local:1433@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL*$BBE
```


Remove the `:1433` because `john` consider ':' as end of line

```
$krb5tgs$23$*svc_sql$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$MSSQLSvc/SQL01.inlanefreight.local@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL*$BBE
```

Now it should work without any issue,

Alternatively we can use hashcat for this

```
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
```
